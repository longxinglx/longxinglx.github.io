## Description

Welcome to Long Xing's Blog, a platform where I share my technical insights, personal notes, and a variety of other works. The goal of this blog is to share knowledge and engage in meaningful discussion with others.

Feel free to explore my writings at [longxinglx.github.io](https://longxinglx.github.io/).

## Repository Structure

All my blog posts can be found in the `./_posts` directory, and the accompanying images for each post are stored in the `./assets/posts_assets` directory. You are welcome to download them.

## Theme Used

This project is built using the [Chirpy Jekyll theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), a minimal, responsive and feature-rich Jekyll theme for technical writing. Special thanks to the creators and contributors of the Chirpy theme for their excellent work.
